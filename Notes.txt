Certificate: Front-end Developer
Level: Advanced

=== { User stories } ===
- I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
- I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
- I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

=== { Notes before startingn } ===

=== { To-do list } ===

v create flow of the app
	v initial state
	v global vars, workTime vs breakTime
	v user input
v Canvas display Q: which display methods to use (html / canvas);
v understand how timers work
- build UI
	v slim timer
	- input range set to 5 and 25 upon load
	- empty top, fill bottom (functions)

- determine structure in how to build the app
	- build sandtimer component with functions to work it
	model, view, viewmodel
- copy all code to codepen
- check cross browser compatibility

=== [ flow of the app ] ===
- initialise the start state of the app
- onclick timer turns and sand starts flowing
- in the loop, top part goes down, bottom part goes up
- full, timer automatically turns break time starts
- if continues loop is on, the app loops back to the same trigger as the onclick event
- else stop

=== { Build notes } ===

Initialise
	worktime = 25 minutes
	breaktime = 5 minutes
	awaiting click to start

Click
	Timer is started
	Display the time remaining / hour glass filling up.

Click again
	Timer is stopped

Reset
	vars are cleared

Layout
	Rectangle screen 
	circle in the middle, top, slowely walking and filling itself

Fill-options
	div, increasing / decreasing it's height
	canvas drawing, circle

resources:
Only draw in a certani area using clip();
usage:
draw a shape, clip it.
optional save the canvas state, ctx.save(); // paths are saved
Anything that follows now is drawn only within the clipping area

Animation of the timer

User for user interaction (e.g. draw sand, user wants to stop)
setInterval(function, delay)

User the below for no user interaction:	(changing the sandTimer)
requestAnimationFrame(callback)

Technologies used
HTML Canvas
HTML5, range and color inputs
